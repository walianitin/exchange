Tech Stack
Frontend:
Next.js & React: For dynamic, server-rendered interfaces.
TailwindCSS: For responsive, modern UI styling.
Backend:
Node.js & Express: Provides a fast, non-blocking environment for API services.
Database:
PostgreSQL: For reliable transactional data storage.
Time Series DB: For logging and analyzing high-frequency trade data.
Real-Time Communication:
WebSockets (Socket.io): To push immediate market updates and trade notifications.
Queue & Pub/Sub:
Redis: Used to decouple order submission from processing and for distributing events.
Order Matching Engine:
Custom-built in Node.js: Processes and matches orders efficiently.
Deployment:
Railway: Currently Deployed on Railway.
Architecture & Data Flow
1. Order Submission
User Interaction:
Users submit buy/sell orders via the responsive frontend.
API Processing:
The frontend sends a POST request to /api/v1/order with the order details. The API validates these details and enqueues the order into Redis, isolating user requests from backend processing.
2. Order Processing & Matching
Order Matching Engine:
Continuously polls the Redis queue, processing orders with a custom matching algorithm. When matching criteria are met, the engine executes a trade and triggers a trade_created event.
3. Data Distribution & Persistence
Real-Time Updates:
Redis Pub/Sub broadcasts trade executions and order book updates to WebSocket-connected clients, ensuring traders see live market data.
Data Storage:
Executed trades are stored in PostgreSQL for transactional integrity. Simultaneously, a Time Series DB logs price and volume data for further analytics.
Key Features
Real-Time Execution:
Ultra-fast order matching ensures minimal delay between submission and trade execution.
Scalability:
A modular, event-driven design allows seamless horizontal scaling as demand increases.
Robust Data Management:
Combines reliable transactional storage with high-frequency data logging for in-depth market analytics.
Live Market Updates:
WebSockets provide traders with immediate, real-time updates on market conditions.
Challenges & Solutions
Handling High Throughput:
Challenge: Managing large volumes of concurrent orders.
Solution: Leveraged Redis for queuing to decouple order intake from processing, thus avoiding bottlenecks.

Ensuring Real-Time Trade Execution:
Challenge: Minimizing delays between order submission and trade execution.
Solution: Optimized the matching engine and used WebSockets combined with Redis Pub/Sub for fast, reliable updates.

Efficient Data Persistence:
Challenge: Storing high-frequency trading data without impacting performance.
Solution: Adopted a dual-database strategy—using PostgreSQL for transactional data and a Time Series DB for analytics.
